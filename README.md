# Instructions

Clone this repo and place it under htdocs in MAMP or XAMPP.

## MySQL

In order for the application to run, the database must first be set up.
Copy and paste the code from createdb.sql into phpMyAdmin!

### Skip this if you are using XAMPP
If you are using MAMP, you also need to change the mysqli login credentials in helpers/db.php.
Change the password to be root and stash your changes in git.


## TLS

Note: It is not necessary to set up TLS in order to run and test the application.

Configuration files for TLS (tested on Mac using MAMP) are included in conf/tls.
It was set up based on the following guide:
